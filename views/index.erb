  <h2>What's a Munro anyway?</h2>
  <p>A Munro is a mountain in Scotland which is over 3000 feet (914m) high. These 282 peaks are named after Sir Hugh Munro, who surveyed and catalogued them in 1891. Climbing (otherwise referred to as 'bagging') the Munros is a fantastic way to explore Scotland and see an incredible breadth of the country's natural beauty.  </p>

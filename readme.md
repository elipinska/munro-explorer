<h1>Munro bagging app</h1>

<p>This project aims to create an app allowing hikers to keep track of Munros (mountains in Scotland with a height over 3,000 feet) they climbed. Hikers should have individual profiles displaying basic information about them and stats of their walks. You should be able to browse through a list of Munros, as well as create new hikes and view them.</p>


<h2>Learning objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>build a web app using HTML, CSS (with Flexbox for responsive design) and Sinatra (web framework written in Ruby),</li>
  <li>practice CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete),</li>
  <li>practice using the <a href="https://learn.co/lessons/sinatra-restful-routes-readme" target="_blank">7 RESTful routes</a>,</li>
  <li>implement a database using Postgres,</li>
  <li>practice good UX design through creating user stories, user journeys, proto-personas, wireframes, and using them throughout the project.</li>
  <li>deploy a web app</li>
</ul>

<h2>MVP:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Display a list of hikers</li>
  <li>Show individual hikers and see a list of all Munros they've climbed</li>
  <li>Display a list of Munros</li>
  <li>Show individual Munros and see how many hikers have climbed it</li>
  <li>View all hikes (ordered by the latest)</li>
  <li>Create new hikes</li>
  <li>Create new hikers</li>
</ul>

### Possible Extensions:

- Display the highest Munro climbed for each hiker
- Add a difficulty level to each Munro; display the most difficult Munro for each hiker
- View hikes by region
- Allow hikers to have personal goals (e.g. climb 10 Munros)
